# Processing S3 Cloud Data and Binning by Spatial and Temporal Dimensions.

This code will help you import necessary libraries and modules, sets up a Dask cluster, defines various bin functions and a function to retrieve data batches from a list. It also defines a function to calculate moving averages and another function to print elapsed time. Finally, it sets up a loop to process data for each day in a list of S3 day folders.

Within the loop, the code initializes two arrays and iterates over batches of data. For each batch, it reads data from an S3 bucket, filters the data based on a list of zip codes, creates a unique index for the data, preprocesses datetime data, computes minute, heading, latitude, and longitude bins, and optimizes the data structure.
